OpenTable Front-End Test
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test. You should spend no more than 2 hours on this application. Please reach out to us if you have any questions about the test.


## The task

We would like you to build a web application.
- The application will allow one user to select dishes on behalf of two diners.
- The application will present a menu that will be provided and may later require adjustment by a restaurant.
- The application will enforce some restrictions provided by the restaurant. (see [#rules](#rules))

We've prepared a simple data file which contains an example menu with prices to help get you started.

Feel free to use any scaffold for example: 

- http://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html 
- https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

Please write as clean and maintainable code as possible, and make sure that it's covered by test cases.


## Rules

_To recap, you will build an interface that allows a user to select dishes for a fixed party of **two diners**._
This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course.
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.


## Acceptance criteria

- The total bill amount is displayed when at least one dish has been selected.
- An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.


## Submission

Please submit your program either by sending a zip file or by providing a link to a repository, dropbox, etc to your point of contact at OpenTable.
